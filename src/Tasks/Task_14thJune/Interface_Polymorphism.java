//Interface Polymorphism
//ðŸ”¶ Objective:
//Learn how interfaces support polymorphism â€“
// calling the same method on different implementations.
//ðŸ”¶ Steps:
//Create an interface Playable with method play().
//Create two classes: Guitar and Piano, both implement Playable.
//Implement the play() method in both classes with different messages.
//In main(), declare a reference of type Playable and assign
// it objects of Guitar and Piano one by one.

//Call play() on each.
//ðŸ”¶ Expected Output:
//Playing Guitar
//Playing Piano
