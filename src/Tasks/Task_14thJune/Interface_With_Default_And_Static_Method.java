// Interface with Default and Static Method
//ðŸ”¶ Objective:
//Learn how to use default and static methods in interfaces (since Java 8).
//ðŸ”¶ Steps:
//Create an interface Vehicle.
//Add a default method start() that prints "Vehicle started".
//Add a static method fuelType() that prints "Fuel type is Petrol".
//Create a class Car that implements Vehicle.
//In main(), create a Car object and call start().
//Call Vehicle.fuelType() without creating an object.
//ðŸ”¶ Expected Output:
//Vehicle started
//Fuel type is Petrol
